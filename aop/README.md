# Run example

If you already have the `validate` tool installed elsewhere, update the below path to it.

```shell
npm install --save shex
./node_modules/shex/bin/validate -d aop.ttl -x ker.shex -n http://identifiers.org/aop.relationships/597
```

The Jupyter notebook also contains the same ShEx example, for both a local `.ttl` file and through a SPARQL query against a public SPARQL endpoint.
